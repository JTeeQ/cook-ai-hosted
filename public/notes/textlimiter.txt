\\So apperantly we can limit the number of tokens OAI API will generate to ensure that it drops the explaination stuff. Here is an example

import openai

# Your API key
api_key = 'your_api_key'

# Prompt for generating recipe
prompt = 'Generate a recipe for a delicious chocolate cake.'

# Parameters for the request
params = {
    'prompt': prompt,
    'max_tokens': 500  # Adjust this value as needed
}

# Initialize the OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = api_key

# Generate the recipe
response = openai.Completion.create(**params)

# Extract the generated recipe
generated_recipe = response['choices'][0]['text']

# Display or process the generated recipe as needed
print(generated_recipe)
